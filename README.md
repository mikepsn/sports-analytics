# Sports Analytics and Data Science of Sports Results

# Overview
This is a masters student research project investigating different ways of analysing the results of sports matches. 
The idea is to compare different unsupervised machine learning algorithms to gain insight into the results for sports matches. 
The student can focus on a single sport, a league or a particular team (or look at statistics for players). 

The research project will explore two categories of machine learning algorithms:
- [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) and 
- [Dimensionality Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)

## Algorithms

- k-Means Clustering
